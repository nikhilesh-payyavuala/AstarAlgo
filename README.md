AstarAlgo
=========
Multi-agent pathfinding was implemented in multiple computing platforms. The A* algorithm was implemented for multiple agents moving on the same map. OpenMP , CUDA and MPI were used to carry out the project on multiple parallel computing platforms. The resulting performance on the various platforms was analysed and conclusions were drawn regarding the suitability of the parallel computing platforms in computing irregular graph algorithms such as the A* algorithm
